# ✅ FIXED: Backup Restore Type Casting Error

**Error:** `List<dynamic> is not a subtype of List<Map<String,dynamic>>`  
**When:** Restoring backup from Google Drive

## Solution
Fixed type casting in `_restoreAllAppData()` method.

## What Was Changed

### File:
`lib/core/services/google_drive_service.dart`

### Changes:

**For Lists (fixed_costs, expenses, expense_goals):**
```dart
// OLD ❌
await PrefsHelper.saveList(PREF_FIXED_COSTS, data['fixed_costs']);

// NEW ✅
final List<dynamic> rawList = data['fixed_costs'] as List<dynamic>;
final List<Map<String, dynamic>> fixedCosts = 
    rawList.map((item) => Map<String, dynamic>.from(item as Map)).toList();
await PrefsHelper.saveList(PREF_FIXED_COSTS, fixedCosts);
```

**For Maps (vault_data, settings, saving_goal):**
```dart
// OLD ❌
await PrefsHelper.saveData(PREF_VAULT, data['vault_data']);

// NEW ✅
final Map<String, dynamic> vaultData = 
    Map<String, dynamic>.from(data['vault_data'] as Map);
await PrefsHelper.saveData(PREF_VAULT, vaultData);
```
