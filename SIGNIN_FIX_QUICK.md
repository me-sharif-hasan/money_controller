# ✅ QUICK FIX: Sign-In Issues Resolved

## Problems Fixed

### 1. ❌ Double Sign-In
**Before:** Sign-in function called twice (redundant)  
**After:** ✅ Sign-in called only once

### 2. ❌ No Session Persistence
**Before:** Had to sign in every time  
**After:** ✅ Sign in once, stays signed in

## What Changed

**File:** `lib/core/services/google_drive_service.dart`

### Key Fixes:

1. **Removed Double State Update**
   - Only listener updates state now
   - No manual assignment causing duplicate

2. **Improved Silent Sign-In**
   - Better session restoration
   - Proper error handling
   - Added logging

3. **Added Token Refresh**
   - Detects expired tokens
   - Automatically refreshes
   - Seamless user experience

4. **Authentication Checks**
   - Verify before each operation
   - Auto-refresh if needed
   - Better error messages

## Testing

### Quick Test:
```bash
# 1. Sign in
flutter run
Settings → Sign in with Google

# 2. Close app
# 3. Restart app
flutter run

# 4. Check Settings
# Expected: ✅ Already signed in
# Can backup immediately without re-sign-in
```

### Verify Fix:
Watch console logs:
```
✅ "GoogleSignIn: Silent sign-in successful"
✅ "Already signed in as [email]"
✅ Only ONE sign-in flow (not two)
```

### Before:
- Had to sign in every time
- Double sign-in popups
- Constant re-authentication

### After:
- Sign in once
- Stay signed in
- Backup works immediately
- No redundant prompts
