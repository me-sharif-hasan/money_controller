# âœ… ISSUE RESOLVED: Vault Budget Sync

## Problem Report
**Issue:** Deleting and updating vault transactions were not updating the remaining balance.

## Root Cause
When vault transactions were edited or deleted, only the vault balance was updated. The main budget (Total Money) was not being adjusted, causing the remaining balance to be incorrect.

## Solution Implemented

### Understanding the Relationship
- **Vault Balance**: Money stored in vault
- **Total Money**: Main budget (includes money not in vault)
- **Relationship**: When vault increases, total money should decrease (money moved from budget to vault)

### Code Changes

**File Modified:** `/lib/views/vault/vault_page.dart`

#### 1. Edit Transaction Fix
```dart
// Calculate the change in transaction amount
balanceChange = newAmount - oldAmount

// Update vault
await vaultProvider.updateTransaction(updatedTransaction)

// Sync with budget
if (balanceChange != 0) {
  await budgetProvider.deductMoney(balanceChange)
}
```

**Logic:**
- If transaction increases by 100: Vault +100, Budget -100
- If transaction decreases by 100: Vault -100, Budget +100

#### 2. Delete Transaction Fix
```dart
// Get transaction amount before deleting
final transaction = vaultProvider.transactions.firstWhere(...)

// Delete from vault
await vaultProvider.deleteTransaction(transactionId)

// Return money to budget
await budgetProvider.addMoney(transaction.amount)
```

**Logic:**
- Deleting a +500 transaction: Vault -500, Budget +500
- Deleting a -200 transaction: Vault +200, Budget -200

#### 3. Update Balance Fix
```dart
// Calculate balance change
balanceChange = newBalance - currentBalance

// Update vault balance
await vaultProvider.updateVaultBalance(newBalance)

// Sync with budget
if (balanceChange != 0) {
  await budgetProvider.deductMoney(balanceChange)
}
```

**Logic:**
- Increasing vault by 300: Vault +300, Budget -300
- Decreasing vault by 200: Vault -200, Budget +200
