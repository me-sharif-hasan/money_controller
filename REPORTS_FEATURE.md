# Expense Reports Feature - Documentation

## Overview
A comprehensive reporting page has been added to the Money Controller app that allows users to view and analyze their expenses across different time periods.

## New Files Created

### 1. `lib/core/utils/report_utils.dart`
Utility class containing helper methods for expense reporting:
- **`filterByRange()`**: Filters expenses within a date range (inclusive)
- **`aggregateByDay()`**: Groups expenses by day with formatted dates
- **`aggregateByWeek()`**: Groups expenses by week (Monday-Sunday)
- **`aggregateByMonth()`**: Groups expenses by month
- **`aggregateByCategory()`**: Groups expenses by category
- **`calculateTotal()`**: Calculates total from aggregated data

### 2. `lib/views/reports/report_page.dart`
The main report page UI with 4 tabs:
- **Daily Tab**: Shows expenses for today grouped by day
- **Weekly Tab**: Shows expenses for current week (Monday-Sunday)
- **Monthly Tab**: Shows expenses for current month
- **Custom Tab**: Allows users to select custom date range

## Features

### 1. Time Period Views
- **Daily**: Displays all expenses for today
- **Weekly**: Shows expenses for the current week (Monday to Sunday)
- **Monthly**: Displays expenses for the current month
- **Custom**: User can select any start and end date

### 2. Data Presentation
Each report view shows:
- **Total Expenses**: Large summary card with total amount and transaction count
- **Category Breakdown**: Pie-chart style breakdown showing:
  - Amount spent per category
  - Percentage of total per category
  - Categories sorted by highest spend
- **Time Period Breakdown**: List view showing:
  - Individual periods (days/weeks/months)
  - Amount spent in each period
  - Periods sorted from newest to oldest

### 3. Visual Design
- Material Design with primary color theming
- Gradient cards for totals
- Icon-based navigation with tabs
- Responsive layout with proper spacing
- Empty state handling with helpful messages

## Navigation
The Reports page is accessible from:
1. Home page drawer menu (new "Reports" menu item with analytics icon)
2. Direct navigation via `Navigator.push` to `ReportPage`

## Data Compatibility
The implementation uses the existing data structure:
- **No changes required** to existing expense storage
- Uses `ExpenseModel` with `DateTime date` field (already present)
- Reads from `ExpenseProvider.expenses` (existing provider)
- Works with existing persistence via `PrefsHelper`

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Used
- `intl` package (already in project) - for date formatting
- `provider` - for state management (accessing ExpenseProvider and SettingProvider)
- `flutter/material.dart` - for UI components

### Date Range Calculations
- **Daily**: Current day (00:00:00 to 23:59:59)
- **Weekly**: Monday of current week to Sunday
- **Monthly**: First day of month to last day of month
- **Custom**: User-selected start and end dates (validated)

### Aggregation Logic
Expenses are filtered by date range first, then aggregated:
1. Filter by date range
2. Group by period (day/week/month)
3. Sum amounts for each group
4. Sort by period (newest first)
5. Calculate category breakdown
6. Display in formatted lists

## User Experience

### Custom Date Range
- Select start and end dates using Material date picker
- Validation: Start date must be before end date
- Edit buttons to change dates after selection
- Clear visual feedback with date range display

### Empty States
- "No expenses found" when no data matches filters
- "Select start and end dates" for custom range
- Helpful icons and messages guide user actions

### Error Handling
- Date validation for custom ranges
- Graceful handling of empty expense lists
- Loading states while data is being fetched

## Testing Checklist

## Impact on Existing Features
âœ… **No breaking changes** - All existing features continue to work:

- Budget management
- Vault functionality
- Fixed costs
- Expense goals
- Settings and Google Sign-in
- Backup and restore

The report page is purely additive - it reads existing data without modifying any data structures or persistence logic.
