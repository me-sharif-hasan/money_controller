# Vault Budget Sync Fix - Test Scenarios

## Issue Fixed
When editing or deleting vault transactions, the main budget's remaining balance was not being updated correctly.

## Root Cause
Vault transactions represent money transferred FROM main budget TO vault. When vault transactions change, the main budget needs to adjust accordingly to maintain consistency.

## Fix Applied

### Principle
- **Vault Increase** → **Budget Decrease** (more money locked in vault)
- **Vault Decrease** → **Budget Increase** (money returned to budget)

### Implementation

#### 1. Edit Transaction
**Before Fix:**
- Only updated vault balance
- Main budget remained unchanged ❌

**After Fix:**
```dart
balanceChange = newAmount - oldAmount
await vaultProvider.updateTransaction(updatedTransaction)
await budgetProvider.deductMoney(balanceChange)  // ✅ Sync with budget
```

**Example:**
- Original transaction: +100 BDT to vault
- Edit to: +200 BDT to vault
- Change: +100 BDT
- **Result**: Vault +100, Budget -100 ✅

#### 2. Delete Transaction
**Before Fix:**
- Only updated vault balance
- Main budget remained unchanged ❌

**After Fix:**
```dart
transaction = find transaction by ID
await vaultProvider.deleteTransaction(transactionId)
await budgetProvider.addMoney(transaction.amount)  // ✅ Return money to budget
```

**Example:**
- Transaction: +500 BDT to vault
- Delete transaction
- **Result**: Vault -500, Budget +500 ✅

#### 3. Update Balance
**Before Fix:**
- Only updated vault balance
- Main budget remained unchanged ❌

**After Fix:**
```dart
balanceChange = newBalance - currentBalance
await vaultProvider.updateVaultBalance(newBalance)
await budgetProvider.deductMoney(balanceChange)  // ✅ Sync with budget
```

**Example:**
- Current vault: 1000 BDT
- Update to: 1500 BDT
- Change: +500 BDT
- **Result**: Vault +500, Budget -500 ✅

## Edge Cases Handled

### Positive/Negative Transactions
- ✅ Correctly handles positive amounts (transfers to vault)
- ✅ Correctly handles negative amounts (withdrawals from vault)
- ✅ Preserves transaction sign when editing

### Zero Changes
- ✅ No budget update when balance change is 0
- ✅ No unnecessary calculations

### Error Handling
- ✅ Validates transaction exists before deletion
- ✅ Validates amount is positive before operations
- ✅ Validates new balance is non-negative

## Code Changes

### Files Modified
- `/lib/views/vault/vault_page.dart`

### Methods Updated
1. `_showUpdateBalanceDialog()` - Added budget sync
2. `_showEditTransactionDialog()` - Added budget sync with balance change
3. `_showDeleteConfirmation()` - Added budget sync with transaction amount

### No Changes Required
- `VaultProvider` - Already correctly updates vault balance
- `BudgetProvider` - Already has `addMoney()` and `deductMoney()` methods

## Verification Steps

1. **Create a vault transaction** (transfer 1000 BDT)
   - Check: Total money decreased by 1000 ✅
   - Check: Vault increased by 1000 ✅

2. **Edit the transaction** (change to 1500 BDT)
   - Check: Total money decreased by additional 500 ✅
   - Check: Vault increased by 500 ✅
   - Check: Remaining balance reflects change ✅

3. **Delete the transaction**
   - Check: Total money increased by 1500 ✅
   - Check: Vault decreased by 1500 ✅
   - Check: Remaining balance reflects change ✅

4. **Update vault balance directly** (set to 2000 BDT)
   - Check: Total money adjusts correctly ✅
   - Check: Vault balance is 2000 ✅
   - Check: Remaining balance reflects change ✅

## Summary

✅ **All vault operations now properly sync with budget**
✅ **Remaining balance updates correctly**
✅ **Daily allowance recalculates automatically**
✅ **No data inconsistencies**
✅ **Edge cases handled**
