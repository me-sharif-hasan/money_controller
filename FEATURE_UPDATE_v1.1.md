## 🧮 Calculation Logic

### Custom Period Remaining Days
```dart
If period is 10th-9th and today is 15th:
  - Period end: 9th of next month
  - Remaining days = (9th next month) - (15th) = ~24 days

If period is 25th-24th and today is 20th:
  - Still in previous period
  - Period end: 24th of current month
  - Remaining days = 24 - 20 = 4 days
```

### Edit Expense Balance Adjustment
```dart
Old expense: ৳ 100
New expense: ৳ 150
Difference: 150 - 100 = 50
Action: Deduct ৳ 50 from total money

Old expense: ৳ 200
New expense: ৳ 150
Difference: 150 - 200 = -50
Action: Add ৳ 50 to total money
```
