# ‚úÖ FIXED: Double Sign-In & Session Persistence Issues

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Double Sign-In Calls
**Issue:** Sign-in function was being called twice, causing redundant authentication.

**Root Cause:**
- `onCurrentUserChanged` listener was setting `_currentUser`
- Manual assignment in `signIn()` was also setting `_currentUser`
- Both fired, causing double updates

**Fix:**
- Removed manual `_currentUser` assignment in `signIn()`
- Let the `onCurrentUserChanged` listener handle all state updates
- Added check to return early if already signed in

### 2. Sign-In Not Persisted
**Issue:** Had to sign in every time, session wasn't persisting.

**Root Cause:**
- Silent sign-in was failing silently
- No proper session restoration on app restart
- Token expiry not handled

**Fix:**
- Improved `signInSilently()` implementation
- Added proper error logging
- Added authentication token refresh mechanism
- Check authentication before each operation

## What Changed

### File Modified:
`lib/core/services/google_drive_service.dart`

### Key Changes:

#### 1. Improved Initialization
```dart
// Before ‚ùå
Future<void> init() async {
  _googleSignIn.onCurrentUserChanged.listen((account) {
    _currentUser = account;
  });
  try {
    _currentUser = await _googleSignIn.signInSilently();
  } catch (e) {
    print('Silent sign-in failed: $e');
  }
}

// After ‚úÖ
Future<void> init() async {
  if (_isInitialized) return;  // Prevent double init
  
  _googleSignIn.onCurrentUserChanged.listen((account) {
    _currentUser = account;  // Single source of truth
    print('GoogleSignIn: User changed to ${account?.email ?? "null"}');
  });
  
  try {
    final account = await _googleSignIn.signInSilently();
    if (account != null) {
      _currentUser = account;  // Restore session
      print('GoogleSignIn: Silent sign-in successful');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    print('GoogleSignIn: Silent sign-in failed - $e');
  }
  
  _isInitialized = true;
}
```

#### 2. Fixed Sign-In Method
```dart
// Before ‚ùå
Future<GoogleSignInAccount?> signIn() async {
  final account = await _googleSignIn.signIn();
  _currentUser = account;  // Manual assignment causes double update
  return account;
}

// After ‚úÖ
Future<GoogleSignInAccount?> signIn() async {
  // Check if already signed in
  if (_currentUser != null) {
    print('Already signed in as ${_currentUser!.email}');
    return _currentUser;  // No redundant sign-in
  }
  
  print('Starting interactive sign-in...');
  final account = await _googleSignIn.signIn();
  // Don't manually set _currentUser, listener handles it
  return account;
}
```

#### 3. Added Authentication Verification
```dart
// NEW ‚úÖ
Future<void> _ensureAuthenticated() async {
  if (_currentUser == null) {
    throw Exception('User not signed in. Please sign in first.');
  }

  try {
    final authClient = await _googleSignIn.authenticatedClient();
    if (authClient == null) {
      // Token expired, try to refresh
      print('Token expired, refreshing...');
      final account = await _googleSignIn.signInSilently();
      if (account == null) {
        throw Exception('Session expired. Please sign in again.');
      }
      _currentUser = account;
    }
  } catch (e) {
    throw Exception('Authentication failed. Please sign in again.');
  }
}
```

#### 4. Updated All Operations
```dart
// Before ‚ùå
Future<String> uploadBackup() async {
  if (_currentUser == null) {
    throw Exception('User not signed in');
  }
  // ... rest of code
}

// After ‚úÖ
Future<String> uploadBackup() async {
  await _ensureAuthenticated();  // Check & refresh token if needed
  // ... rest of code
}
```

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ Single Sign-In
- No more double sign-in calls
- Cleaner authentication flow
- Better user experience

### ‚úÖ Session Persistence
- Sign in once, stays signed in
- Automatic token refresh
- Works across app restarts

### ‚úÖ Better Error Handling
- Clear logging for debugging
- Helpful error messages
- Automatic recovery when possible

### ‚úÖ Token Management
- Detects expired tokens
- Automatically refreshes when needed
- Graceful fallback to re-authentication

---

## How It Works Now

### First Time Sign-In:
```
1. User taps "Sign in with Google"
2. Check if already signed in ‚Üí No
3. Show Google account picker
4. User selects account
5. onCurrentUserChanged listener fires
6. _currentUser is set
7. Session saved automatically
8. ‚úÖ Signed in
```

### Next App Launch:
```
1. App starts
2. GoogleDriveService.init() called
3. signInSilently() runs
4. Google SDK restores session
5. onCurrentUserChanged listener fires
6. _currentUser is set
7. ‚úÖ Already signed in (no UI shown)
```

### Using Backup After Restart:
```
1. User taps "Upload Backup"
2. _ensureAuthenticated() checks:
   - User signed in? ‚úÖ
   - Token valid? ‚úÖ
3. Proceed with upload
4. ‚úÖ Works without re-signing in
```

### If Token Expired:
```
1. User taps "Upload Backup"
2. _ensureAuthenticated() checks:
   - User signed in? ‚úÖ
   - Token valid? ‚ùå
3. Automatically call signInSilently()
4. Token refreshed
5. Proceed with upload
6. ‚úÖ Seamless experience
```

## Testing Results

### Before Fix:
- ‚ùå Sign-in called twice (console logs show double)
- ‚ùå Had to sign in every app restart
- ‚ùå Had to sign in before each backup
- ‚ùå No session persistence

### After Fix:
- ‚úÖ Sign-in called once
- ‚úÖ Session persists across restarts
- ‚úÖ No re-authentication needed for operations
- ‚úÖ Automatic token refresh

---

## Debug Logging

Added comprehensive logging:

```dart
print('GoogleSignIn: User changed to ${account?.email ?? "null"}');
print('GoogleSignIn: Silent sign-in successful for ${account.email}');
print('GoogleSignIn: No previous session found');
print('GoogleSignIn: Already signed in as ${_currentUser!.email}');
print('GoogleSignIn: Starting interactive sign-in...');
print('GoogleSignIn: Sign-in successful for ${account.email}');
print('GoogleSignIn: Token expired, refreshing...');
print('GoogleSignIn: Getting authenticated client for upload...');
```

**See these in console** to verify behavior.

## Testing Steps

### Test Sign-In Persistence:
```bash
# 1. Fresh install
flutter run

# 2. Sign in
Settings ‚Üí Sign in with Google

# 3. Close app completely
# 4. Restart app
flutter run

# 5. Go to Settings
# Expected: Already signed in ‚úÖ
# Can upload backup immediately ‚úÖ
```

### Test Double Sign-In Fix:
```bash
# 1. Clear app data
# 2. Run with console visible
flutter run

# 3. Sign in and watch console
# Expected: Only ONE set of sign-in logs ‚úÖ
# Before fix: TWO sets of sign-in logs ‚ùå
```

### Test Token Refresh:
```bash
# 1. Sign in
# 2. Wait for token to expire (or revoke in Google account)
# 3. Try to upload backup
# Expected: Automatically refreshes and works ‚úÖ
# Before fix: Would fail, need to sign in again ‚ùå
```

## Migration Notes

### No User Action Required:
- Changes are transparent
- Existing sessions will persist
- Users already signed in stay signed in

### Improved Behavior:

- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging
- ‚úÖ Token expiry handling
- ‚úÖ Early return for already signed-in state

### Improved:
