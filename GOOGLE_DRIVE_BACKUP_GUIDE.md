## üîß Setup Requirements

### 1. Google Cloud Console Setup

You already have `google-services.json` in `/android/app/`. Now you need to add OAuth client:

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Select your project**: money-controller-c5eee
3. **Navigate to**: APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials
4. **Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID**:
   - Application type: Android
   - Package name: `com.iishanto.money_controller`
   - SHA-1 certificate fingerprint: Get it by running:
     ```bash
     cd android
     ./gradlew signingReport
     ```
   - Copy the SHA-1 fingerprint for debug variant

5. **Enable APIs**:
   - Go to: APIs & Services ‚Üí Library
   - Enable: **Google Drive API**
   - Enable: **Google Sign-In API** (if not already enabled)

6. **Download updated google-services.json**:
   - After creating OAuth client, download the updated `google-services.json`
   - Replace the existing file in `/android/app/google-services.json`

### 2. Get SHA-1 Certificate

Run this command to get your SHA-1:
```bash
cd /home/bs01595/Downloads/money_controller/android
./gradlew signingReport
```

Look for the SHA-1 under "Variant: debug" section.

### 3. Update google-services.json

After adding the OAuth client in Google Cloud Console, your `google-services.json` should have an `oauth_client` section like this:

```json
{
  "project_info": {...},
  "client": [
    {
      "client_info": {...},
      "oauth_client": [
        {
          "client_id": "YOUR-CLIENT-ID.apps.googleusercontent.com",
          "client_type": 1,
          "android_info": {
            "package_name": "com.iishanto.money_controller",
            "certificate_hash": "YOUR_SHA1_HASH"
          }
        }
      ],
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Backup Frequency
- **Manual only** - You control when to backup
- Recommended: Backup after major changes
- Backup before uninstalling app
- Backup weekly for safety

### Data Replacement
- Restore **replaces all current data**
- No merge - complete replacement
- Future: We can add selective merge/date-based merge

### One Backup Per Account
- Only latest backup is kept
- Uploading new backup overwrites old one
- Keep one backup per Google account

### Network Required
- Backup/Restore needs internet connection
- Use WiFi for faster upload/download
- No offline backup support

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Sign in failed"
**Solution:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify SHA-1 is added to Google Console
3. Ensure OAuth client is created
4. Re-download google-services.json

### "No backup found"
**Cause:** Never uploaded backup with this account
**Solution:** Upload backup first

### "Upload failed"
**Possible causes:**
1. No internet connection
2. Google Drive API not enabled
3. Insufficient Google Drive storage
4. OAuth permissions not granted

**Solution:**
1. Check internet
2. Enable Google Drive API in console
3. Check Google Drive storage
4. Sign out and sign in again

### "Download failed"
**Possible causes:**
1. Backup file corrupted
2. No internet connection
3. OAuth token expired

**Solution:**
1. Upload fresh backup
2. Check internet
3. Sign out and sign in again
