# Quick Reference: Vault-Budget Sync Fix

## The Problem
❌ **Before:** Editing/deleting vault transactions only changed vault balance
❌ **Result:** Total money and remaining balance stayed the same (incorrect!)

## The Solution
✅ **After:** All vault operations now sync with main budget
✅ **Result:** Both vault and budget stay in sync (correct!)

---

## Visual Example

### Before Fix ❌
```
Initial State:
├─ Total Money: 10,000 BDT
├─ Vault: 1,000 BDT
└─ Remaining: 9,000 BDT

User edits vault transaction: 1,000 → 1,500

After Edit:
├─ Total Money: 10,000 BDT  ❌ WRONG! (Should be 9,500)
├─ Vault: 1,500 BDT
└─ Remaining: 9,000 BDT  ❌ WRONG! (Should be 8,500)
```

### After Fix ✅
```
Initial State:
├─ Total Money: 10,000 BDT
├─ Vault: 1,000 BDT
└─ Remaining: 9,000 BDT

User edits vault transaction: 1,000 → 1,500

After Edit:
├─ Total Money: 9,500 BDT  ✅ CORRECT!
├─ Vault: 1,500 BDT
└─ Remaining: 8,500 BDT  ✅ CORRECT!
```

## Quick Test

1. **Note your current:**
   - Total Money: _______
   - Vault Balance: _______
   - Remaining Balance: _______

2. **Edit a vault transaction**
   - Change amount by +100
   
3. **Check:**
   - ✅ Total Money decreased by 100?
   - ✅ Vault increased by 100?
   - ✅ Remaining Balance decreased by 100?

4. **Delete that transaction**

5. **Check:**
   - ✅ Everything returned to original values?

If all checks pass: **Fix is working!** ✅

## Code Changes Summary

**File:** `lib/views/vault/vault_page.dart`

**Changes:**
1. `_showEditTransactionDialog()` - Now syncs budget
2. `_showDeleteConfirmation()` - Now syncs budget  
3. `_showUpdateBalanceDialog()` - Now syncs budget

**Key Addition:**
```dart
// When vault changes, sync with budget
await budgetProvider.deductMoney(balanceChange);  // or addMoney()
```
