### 2. Expense Goals (NEW!)

#### **What is an Expense Goal?**
An expense goal helps you save money for a specific future expense by automatically reducing your daily allowance. This ensures you have the required amount ready when you need it.

#### **Use Case Example**
*"I have a program in 7 days where I need 500 BDT extra"*

**Solution:**
1. Create an Expense Goal:
   - Title: "Program Event"
   - Amount: 500 BDT
   - Target Date: 7 days from today

2. The app will:
   - Calculate daily requirement: 500 √∑ 7 = 71.43 BDT/day
   - Reduce your daily allowance by 71.43 BDT for the next 7 days
   - After 7 days, your allowance returns to normal
   - You'll have saved 500 BDT for your program!

#### **How to Use Expense Goals**

**Access:**
- Open drawer menu ‚Üí "Expense Goals"

**Create a Goal:**
1. Tap the floating "Add Goal" button
2. Enter:
   - **Goal Title**: Name of the expense (e.g., "New Phone", "Trip", "Program")
   - **Target Amount**: How much you need to save
   - **Target Date**: When you need the money
3. Tap "Add"

**View Goals:**
- **Active Goals**: Currently saving towards
- **Completed Goals**: Goals you've achieved
- **Overdue Goals**: Passed target date without completion

**Goal Information Shows:**
- Days remaining until target date
- Daily requirement amount (how much less you'll have per day)
- Total daily requirement (sum of all active goals)

**Manage Goals:**
- **Edit**: Tap menu (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí "Edit" to modify title, amount, or date
- **Mark Complete**: Tap menu (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí "Mark Complete" when goal is achieved
- **Delete**: Tap menu (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí "Delete" to remove goal

### 3. Smart Daily Allowance Calculation

#### **How it Works:**

**Without Expense Goals:**
```
Daily Allowance = (Total Money - Fixed Costs) √∑ Remaining Days
```

**With Expense Goals:**
```
Daily Allowance = (Total Money - Fixed Costs) √∑ Remaining Days - Goal Requirements
```

#### **Example Calculation:**

**Scenario:**
- Total Money: 10,000 BDT
- Fixed Costs: 3,000 BDT
- Remaining Days: 20 days
- Expense Goal: 500 BDT in 7 days

**Calculation:**
1. Base Allowance: (10,000 - 3,000) √∑ 20 = 350 BDT/day
2. Goal Requirement: 500 √∑ 7 = 71.43 BDT/day
3. **Adjusted Allowance: 350 - 71.43 = 278.57 BDT/day**

**Result:**
- For the next 7 days: Spend only 278.57 BDT/day
- After 7 days: Spend full 350 BDT/day again
- You'll have 500 BDT saved for your goal!
