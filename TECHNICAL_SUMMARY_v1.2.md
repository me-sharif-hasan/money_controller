## Architecture

### Expense Goal System

```
ExpenseGoalProvider (State Management)
    ↓
ExpenseGoalModel (Data Model)
    ↓
PrefsHelper (Persistence)
    ↓
SharedPreferences (Storage)
```

### Budget Integration

```
ExpenseGoalProvider.totalDailyRequirement
    ↓
BudgetProvider.setExpenseGoalRequirement()
    ↓
BudgetProvider._calculateSummary()
    ↓
calculateDailyAllowanceWithGoals()
    ↓
Updated Daily Allowance
```

### Vault Management

```
VaultProvider Methods:
├── transferToVault() [existing]
├── withdrawFromVault() [existing]
├── updateVaultBalance() [NEW]
├── updateTransaction() [NEW]
└── deleteTransaction() [NEW]
```

## Data Flow

### Creating an Expense Goal

1. User fills form in ExpenseGoalPage
2. ExpenseGoalProvider.addGoal() called
3. Goal saved to SharedPreferences
4. Provider notifies listeners
5. HomePage watches ExpenseGoalProvider
6. HomePage syncs with BudgetProvider
7. BudgetProvider recalculates daily allowance
8. UI updates with new allowance

### Editing Vault Transaction

1. User taps edit on transaction
2. Dialog shows current values
3. User updates amount/type
4. VaultProvider.updateTransaction() called
5. Balance difference calculated
6. Vault balance updated
7. Transaction list updated
8. Changes saved to SharedPreferences

## Key Algorithms

### Daily Allowance with Goals

```dart
double calculateDailyAllowanceWithGoals(
  double total, 
  double fixed, 
  int remainingDays, 
  double goalRequirement
) {
  if (remainingDays <= 0) return 0;
  final remaining = total - fixed;
  final baseAllowance = remaining / remainingDays;
  return baseAllowance - goalRequirement;
}
```

### Total Daily Requirement

```dart
double get totalDailyRequirement {
  return activeGoals.fold(
    0.0, 
    (sum, goal) => sum + goal.dailyRequirement
  );
}
```

### Goal Daily Requirement

```dart
double get dailyRequirement {
  final days = daysUntilTarget;
  if (days <= 0) return 0.0;
  final remaining = amount - savedAmount;
  return remaining > 0 ? remaining / days : 0.0;
}
```

## State Management

### Provider Hierarchy

```
main.dart
├── BudgetProvider
├── ExpenseProvider
├── VaultProvider
├── SettingProvider
└── ExpenseGoalProvider [NEW]
```

### Provider Communication

```
ExpenseGoalProvider → BudgetProvider (one-way sync)
```

The HomePage acts as a bridge, watching ExpenseGoalProvider and updating BudgetProvider when totalDailyRequirement changes.

## UI Components

### New Dialogs

1. **Update Balance Dialog** (VaultPage)
   - Input field for new balance
   - Validation for non-negative values

2. **Withdraw Dialog** (VaultPage)
   - Input field for withdrawal amount
   - Updates both vault and budget

3. **Edit Transaction Dialog** (VaultPage)
   - Amount and type fields
   - Preserves transaction sign (positive/negative)

4. **Add/Edit Goal Dialog** (ExpenseGoalPage)
   - Title, amount, and date picker
   - Validation for required fields

### New UI Elements

1. **Popup Menus**
   - Vault page app bar menu
   - Transaction item menus
   - Goal card menus

2. **Goal Cards**
   - Status indicators
   - Progress display
   - Daily requirement highlight

## Data Persistence

### Storage Keys

```dart
PREF_EXPENSE_GOALS = 'expense_goals'
```

### Data Structure

```json
{
  "expense_goals": [
    {
      "id": "timestamp",
      "title": "Goal name",
      "amount": 1000.0,
      "targetDate": "ISO8601 date",
      "createdAt": "ISO8601 date",
      "isCompleted": false,
      "savedAmount": 0.0
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling

1. **Null Safety**: All new code uses null-safe Dart
2. **Validation**: Input validation before operations
3. **Fallbacks**: Safe defaults for missing data
4. **Try-Catch**: Provider methods handle exceptions

## Performance Considerations

1. **Lazy Calculation**: Daily requirements calculated on-demand
2. **Efficient Filtering**: Goals filtered by status using where()
3. **Single Sync**: HomePage syncs only when values change
4. **Minimal Rebuilds**: Providers notify only when state changes

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests Needed

1. ExpenseGoalModel calculations
2. calculateDailyAllowanceWithGoals()
3. Goal filtering logic
4. Transaction balance recalculation

### Integration Tests Needed

1. Goal creation flow
2. Goal-to-budget synchronization
3. Vault transaction CRUD operations
4. Multi-goal scenario

### UI Tests Needed

1. Expense goal page navigation
2. Dialog interactions
3. Goal status display
4. Vault menu actions

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Auto-Transfer**: Automatically transfer goal amount to vault on completion
2. **Goal Categories**: Categorize goals (emergency, leisure, bills, etc.)
3. **Goal History**: Track historical goal performance
4. **Budget Period Sync**: Align goals with budget period instead of calendar days
5. **Goal Templates**: Save and reuse common goal types
6. **Notifications**: Remind users when goals are due
7. **Goal Analytics**: Show savings patterns and goal completion rates

### Refactoring Opportunities

1. Extract dialog builders to separate widget files
2. Create reusable goal card widget
3. Add repository layer for data access
4. Implement proper error handling with Either type
5. Add logging for debugging
